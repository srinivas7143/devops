# Differences between VMs and Docker containers

These are a few of the differences between VMs and Docker containers:

Docker is application-oriented, whereas VMs are operating-system oriented.

Docker containers share an operating system with other Docker containers. 
In contrast, VMs each have their own operating system managed by a hypervisor. 

Docker containers are designed to run one principal process, not manage multiple sets of processes.
