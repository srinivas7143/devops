A regular vocabulary of words, abbreviations, and symbols. Some might be familiar, others mystifying.

Rules about what can be said, and where — syntax.

A sequence of operations to be performed in order.

Sometimes, a repetition of some operations (a loop), such as the method for frying each piece of lefse.

Sometimes, a reference to another sequence of operations (in computer terms, a function). In the recipe, you might need to refer to another recipe for ricing potatoes.

Assumed knowledge about the context. The recipe assumes you know what water is and how to boil it. The knitting pattern assumes that you can knit and purl without stabbing yourself too often.

Some data to be used, created, or modified — potatoes and yarn.

The tools used to work with the data — pots, mixers, ovens, knitting sticks.

An expected result. In our examples, something for your feet and something for your stomach. Just don’t mix them up.
