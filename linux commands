#You can force a process (like SSH) to automatically load on system startup using systemctl enable ssh 

1.systemctl stop ssh

#To not load on startup with systemctl disable ssh 

2.systemctl enable ssh

#If you want to visualize parent and child shells/processes, you can use the pstree command (adding the -p argument 
#to display the PIDs for each process). Note how the first process (assigned PID 1) is systemd. On older versions of 
#Linux (Ubuntu 14.04 and earlier, for instance), this would have been called init instead:

3.pstree -p (with PID)
